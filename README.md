# Blockchain Project

This project is a basic implementation of a blockchain, demonstrating core concepts such as hashing, block creation, and a simple transaction system

## Features

* **Block Creation:**  Creates new blocks with transactions and a hash of the previous block.
* **Hashing:**  Uses a secure hashing algorithm to ensure data integrity.
* **Transaction System:**  Allows for the creation and processing of simple transactions..

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**  Install Python 3.x
2. **Cloning the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/Qyuzet/Blockchain.git`
3. **Running the Project:** 
   * Navigate to the project directory: `cd Blockchain`
   * Choose the intended project on the directory

## Future Development

* Implement consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS).
* Add features like smart contract support, network communication, or a more advanced transaction system.
